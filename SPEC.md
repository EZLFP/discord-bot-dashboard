Task: Build a dashboard that allows me to view all of the analytics data related to my discord bot called EZLFP. The Discord bot's purpose is to pair players based on compatibility and automate the lfg process. It has a /link command to onboard users, /queue join to join the queue to match with your most compatible partner, and other commands. All analytics are available at API endpoints. Details are in ANALYTICS_API_REFERENCES.md.
